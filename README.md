## Introduction

The [Wall Street Journal](http://wsj.com) is an excellent financial newspaper, but its RSS feeds are a hot mess. They're an embarassment to the newspaper.

There's too many of them, if you don't subscribe to many you'll miss articles, but if you subscribe to many you'll see a whole mess of duplicated articles.

This fixes that. Put a bunch of feeds in feedlist.txt, run wsjfixer.py every 10 minutes or so, and you'll have a constantly updated feed of Wall Street Journal articles, from just the sources that you want, with no duplicates.


I hope you enjoy it!
